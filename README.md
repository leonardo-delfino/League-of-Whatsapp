# League of WhatsApp
A League of Legends match can last a different amount of time. You can finish in 20 minutes, 
or it can take up to an hour. <br>
While playing is really hard to get distracted by your smartphone. As a result, you won't be
able to check the messages on messaging services like WhatsApp. <br>
However, you can still receive a message from a friend inside the League's client (from a 
RiotGames account), and it will be shown in game. You can also reply to that message directly
from the match (by typing in the chat /r "name of the account" your message). <br><br>
The purpose of this script is to allow the reception (real-time) and response of the messages
from a WhatsApp contact during a League of Legends match.

## How to install
Still developing.

## How does it work
Before executing the script, you have to create another RiotGames account (in the same region
of the one you want to use for the reception / response of the messages). After creating it, 
just send a friend request to your real account. After that, you can run the script.<br>
You have to insert two usernames: the one to receive messages from (in the way it is stored 
on the smartphone), and your personal Whatsapp name. <br>
You can check your WhatsApp name from Menu (the three dots) -> Settings. <br>
You will be now able to receive (it is assumed that every message before your last one have 
already been read) all the text messages (you will also able to reply to them) from the user
you have inserted directly into your match.



## Supported messaging services
By now, only WhatsApp is supported. I plan to also add Telegram once the development for 
Whatsapp is finished.

## TODO
